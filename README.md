# 3D Semantic Segmentation - RSNA 2022

The **[RSNA 2022 Cervical Spine Fracture Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2022-cervical-spine-fracture-detection)** is organized by the Radiological Socity of North America (RSNA) along with the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) and the American Society of Spine Radiology (ASSR).
The ultimate goal of the challenge is to develop an AI system used to aid in the detection and localization of cervical spine fractures.

The training dataset provided is constituted by 2019 CT scans, with one folder for each scan, containing image data in dicom file format. Moreover, segmentation masks (pixel level annotations) are provided for a subset (87 scans) of the training set. The pixels assume values of 1 to 7 for C1 to C7 (seven cervical vertebrae) and 8 to 19 for T1 to T12. This data is provided in the nifti file format. 

This repository contains the first task of the RSNA 2022 challenge, i.e., develop a 3D semantic segmentation model to assign segmentation masks to the unlabelled CT scan in the training data.
